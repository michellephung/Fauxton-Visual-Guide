        # Overview
        Welcome to Fauxton. 
      
        Apache CouchDBâ„¢ is a database
        that uses JSON for documents,
        JavaScript for MapReduce indexes,
        and regular HTTP for its API.
      
        Fauxton is a native web-based interface built into CouchDB. It provides 
        a basic interface to the majority of the functionality, including the 
        ability to create, update, delete and view documents and views, it 
        provides access to the configuration parameters, and an interface for initiating 
        replication.

        # Features: Getting Started
      
        When you first start to use Fauxton, the left most navigation panel will 
        be allow you jump quickly between viewing what's going on in your 
        CouchDB instance. 
      
        You can expand or collapse the navigation by clicking on the area above
        the topmost tab, "Databases", where the icon of the three horizontal 
        lines is. 

        [Databases](#page-all-dbs) will show you a list of all your databases, 
        their size, number of documents, and quicklinks to it's permissions page 
        and replication page.

        [Active Tasks](#page-active-tasks) Displays a list of the running 
        background tasks on the server. Background tasks include view index 
        building, compaction and replication. This page is an interface to 
        the [Active Tasks API](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/server/common.html#api-server-active-tasks)
        call.

        [Config](#page-config) An interface into the configuration of your 
        CouchDB installation. The interface allows you to edit the different 
        configurable parameters. For more details on configuration, see 
        [Configuring CouchDB](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/index.html#config).

        [Replication](#page-replication) An interface to the replication system, 
        enabling you to initiate replication between local and remote databases. 

        [Documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/)
        Will direct you to your local copy of the documentation. The link shown 
        in this guide is to the online version.

        [Login/User Management](#page-login) You can change your password , or 
        add administrator to your CouchDB instance within this tab.

        [Verify](#page-verify) The Verify Installation allows you to check 
        whether all of the components of your CouchDB installation are correctly 
        installed.

        in the database.

        # CORS

        CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. It is setting that 
        pertains only to browsers.

        By enabling CORS, you allow other people, from <i>their</i> computers,
        to access the data you have stored in your CouchDB databases. For 
        example, they can ping your CouchDB instance through an AJAX request,
         and it will return information. Or they can post data to your CouchDB 
         instance, and CORS allows you to recieve that information.

        If you disable CORS, that means that no browser that pings your 
        databases will recieve information. You can also limit who can ping you. 
        If you only want certain websites, or origins, to be able to recieve 
        data from your stores, you can set 'Restrict to specific domains', and 
        then list which origins you want to allow access for.

        By setting, 'All domains', you allow anyone from anywhere to ping your 
        databases, and retrieve information that way.

        This is a browser specific layer of protection, a second layer of 
        protection, if you will. The first layer of protection comes from the 
        permissions you set on each database, and whether they have _reader, 
        _writer, _admin, etc. access.

        # Replication
      
        An interface to the replication system, enabling you to initiate 
        replication between local and remote databases.

        You will see two boxes, with 3 boxes in each bigger box.

        Depending on how big your screen is, the top (or leftmost box) is the 
        Source database. The bottom (or rightmost box) is the Target database.
        
        From the Source database box, you can choose an existing database from 
        the dropdown, by selecting 'Local' like in the image to the left.
        Or you can specify a remote database as the Source, by clicking on 
        'Remote' in that box, and typing in the remote database's address.

        In the Target database box, choose either a local or remote database. If 
        you want to create new database, and replicate into that new DB, check
        the 'Create Target' button.

        For continuous Replications, select the 'continuous' checkbox. 
        'Continous' means that the target database will update itself whenever
        the source database is updated, from now on. It will continue to update
        itself until you cancel the continous replication.

         If you are specifying a remote database name, you must specify the full 
         URL of the remote database (including the host, port number and database 
         name). If the remote instance requires authentication, you can specify 
         the username and password as part of the URL, for example 
         http://username:pass@remotehost:5984/demo.

        Under the [Active Tasks](#page-active-tasks) tab, you should see in the 
        table your new created replication. You might miss it if the database 
        being Replicated is on the small side, but continous replications will
        always show up while they are active.

         For more information, see 
         [/_replicate](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/server/common.html#api-server-replicate). 

         For more information on replication, see [Replication](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/replication/index.html#replication).

          | A: Checkout the 
          a(href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Frequently_asked_questions") CouchDB FAQ
          | .
        p.question Q: Wow! this is awesome! how can I contribute?
        p.answer
          | A: Thanks! If you want to contribute, you can open a pull request on 
          a(href="https://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton") Github
          | .
        p.question Q: What can I do?
        p.answer
          | A: Lots of things! checkout our 
          a(href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB/component/12320406/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:component-summary-panel") JIRA
          |  page for a list of things we need help fixing or building.
        p.question Q: I'm not a programmer. What can I do?
        p.answer.
          A: Good question. There are many things you can do to help out! Find a
          place that you think needs fixing, and find out how to fix it. 

        :markdown
          For example, if you find the documentation a long rabbit hole of links 
          and links (and links and links....) you could come up with a 
          hierarchical system of links or strategy guide that would help out a 
          newbie. 


          If you have design skills, or would like to learn design skills, you 
          can help out by finding a cumbersome or non-intuitive part of CouchDB 
          and/or Fauxton and propose a fix. Good ideas are always welcome :)

          Another thing is documentation. We have a lot, but the more the 
          better! If you find a place in CouchDB that is not well-documented,
          feel free! 

        p.question Q: I found a bug and I think it should be fixed!
        p.answer.
          A: Awesome. Open a pull request and we can make that happen!
