        # Overview
        Welcome to Fauxton. 
      
        Apache CouchDBâ„¢ is a database
        that uses JSON for documents,
        JavaScript for MapReduce indexes,
        and regular HTTP for its API.
      
        Fauxton is a native web-based interface built into CouchDB. It provides 
        a basic interface to the majority of the functionality, including the 
        ability to create, update, delete and view documents and design documents. It 
        provides access to the configuration parameters, and an interface for initiating 
        replication.

        # Features: Getting Started
      
        When you first start to use Fauxton, the left most navigation panel will 
        allow you jump quickly between viewing different parts of what's going 
        on in your CouchDB instance. 
      
        You can expand or collapse the navigation by clicking on the area above
        the topmost tab, "Databases", where the icon of the three horizontal 
        lines is. 

        [Databases](#page-all-dbs) will show you a list of all your databases, 
        their size, number of documents, and provides quick links to it's 
        permissions page and replication page.

        [Active Tasks](#page-active-tasks) displays a list of the running 
        background tasks on the server. Background tasks include view index 
        building, compaction and replication. This page is an interface to 
        the [Active Tasks API](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/server/common.html#api-server-active-tasks)
        call.

        [Config](#page-config) is an interface for the configuration of your 
        CouchDB installation. The interface allows you to edit different 
        configurable parameters. For more details on configuration, see 
        [Configuring CouchDB](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/index.html#config).

        [Replication](#page-replication) is an interface to the replication 
        system, enabling you to initiate replication between local and remote 
        databases. 

        [Documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/)
        will direct you to your local copy of the documentation. The link shown 
        in this guide is to the online version.

        [Login/User Management](#page-login) lets you can change your password, 
        or add administrator to your CouchDB instance.

        [Verify](#page-verify), verifies your installation and allows you to 
        check whether all of the components of your CouchDB installation are 
        correctly installed.

        database.
        
        ** 3 View a Database  **
        This link will take to that database's "[All Docs](#page-all-docs)" 
        page where you can view all of that database's contents. You can also 
        delete, replicate, and change the permissions for a database from the 
        database's 'All Docs' page.
        
        ** 4 Replication Link **
        Jump directly to the Replication page for this database.

        # All Documents
        ** 1 All Documents overview  ** 
        This is the viewing area, the default view shows you all of the 
        documents in your database. If you want to view each document's 
        contents, you can either click 'Query Options', and then 'Include Docs'. 
        To edit a document, you can either click on the pencil in 
        upper right of each card, or double click on the document card, go to 
        the editor page.

        ** 2 Quick Links  **
        These are all links that pertain to this specific database.

        ** 3 View Design Documents  **
        Design Documents are special documents, since they are data, they are
        included in the database as documents, but they are special because they 
        contain functions for Map-Reduce which act on the rest of the documents 
        in the database.

        view, or query an index.
        
        ** 3 Multiple Document Select and delete   **
        Clicking on 'Select' will allow you choose multiple documents, or 
        deselect all the documents for deletion. You can also expand or 
        collapse all of the documents to show more information.
        
        ** 4 Jump to a specific document in this database  ** 
        Use this search bar to jump to a specific document in the database. This 
        field takes the _id of the document you are trying to view. 
        
        ** 5 Query Options   **
        You choose how you want to view the documents in this database using 
        Query Options. 'Include Docs' will show all the data in each document.
        'Keys' will allow to narrow down the documents being viewed on this 
        page based on the parameters you provide.
        
        ** 6 API URL  **
        The API URL button shows up on most pages. All the data in CouchDB is 
        available through a pingable API URL. You can click on this link to view
        and copy the particular API for the page you are viewing.
        Many times, the browser will shows a interface based on one of the API
        endpoints.

        # CORS

        CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. It is setting that 
        pertains only to browsers.

        By enabling CORS, you allow your browser to access data from other 
        people, from <i>their</i> computers. For 
        example, you can ping someone else's CouchDB instance through an AJAX 
        request, and it will return information. Or you can POST data from your 
        CouchDB instance, and CORS allows you to send that information.

        If you disable CORS, that means that no other server that you ping
        databases will return information. You can also limit the people you can
        recieve data from. If you only want certain websites, or origins, to be 
        able to retrieve data from, you can set 'Restrict to specific domains', 
        and then list which origins you want to allow access for.

        By setting, 'All domains', you allow receiving information from anyone,
        anywhere, and retrieve information that way.

        This is a browser specific layer of protection, a second layer of 
        protection, if you will. The first layer of protection comes from the 
        permissions you set on each database, and whether they have _reader, 
        _writer, _admin, etc. access.

      :markdown
        # Replication
      
        An interface to the replication system, enabling you to initiate 
        replication between local and remote databases.

        You will see two boxes, with 3 boxes in each bigger box.

        Depending on how big your screen is, the top (or leftmost box, labeled 
        \#1 in the example) is the Source database. The bottom (or rightmost 
        box, label \#2) is the Target database.
        
        From the Source database box (\#1), you can choose an existing database 
        from the dropdown, by selecting 'Local' like in the image to the left.
        Or you can specify a remote database as the Source, by clicking on 
        'Remote' in that box, and typing in the remote database's address.

        In the Target database box (\#2), choose either a local or remote 
        database. If you want to create a new database, and replicate into that 
        new DB, check the 'Create Target' button.

        For continuous Replications, select the 'continuous' checkbox. 
        'Continous' means that the target database will update itself whenever
        the source database is updated, from now on. It will continue to update
        itself until you cancel the continous replication.

         If you are specifying a remote database name, you must specify the full 
         URL of the remote database (including the host, port number and database 
         name). If the remote instance requires authentication, you can specify 
         the username and password as part of the URL, for example 
         ``http://username:pass@remotehost:5984/demo``.

        Under the [Active Tasks](#page-active-tasks) tab, you should see in the 
        table your new created replication. You might miss it if the database 
        being replicated is on the small side, but continous replications will
        always show up while they are active.

        For more information, see [/_replicate](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/server/common.html#api-server-replicate). 

        For more information on replication, see [Replication](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/replication/index.html#replication).

        p.question Q: Wow! this is awesome! how can I contribute?
        p.answer
          | A: Thanks! If you want to contribute, you can open a pull request on 
          a(href="https://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton") Github
          | .
        p.question Q: What can I do?
        p.answer
          | A: Lots of things! checkout our 
          a(href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB/component/12320406/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:component-summary-panel") JIRA
          |  page for a list of things we need help fixing or building.
        p.question Q: I'm not a programmer. What can I do?
        p.answer.
          A: Good question. There are many things you can do to help out! Find a
          place that you think needs fixing, and find out how to fix it. 

        :markdown
          For example, if you find the documentation a long rabbit hole of links 
          and links (and links and links....) you could come up with a 
          hierarchical system of links or strategy guide that would help out a 
          newbie. 

          If you have design skills, or would like to learn architecture skills, 
          you can help out by finding a cumbersome or non-intuitive part of 
          CouchDB and/or Fauxton and propose a fix. Good ideas are always 
          welcome :)

          Another thing is documentation. We have a lot, but the more the 
          better! If you find a place in CouchDB that is not well-documented,
          feel free! 

        p.question Q: I found a bug and I think it should be fixed!
        p.answer.
          A: Awesome! Open a pull request and we can make that happen!
